<h2 id="cook-mode">Cook Mode</h2>

Cooking with traditional cookbooks is often not the best experience: small text makes it easy to lose one's place. In Noodles, Cook Mode highlights steps and makes reading the recipe in the kitchen much easier.

Here's how it looks:

To open Cook Mode, click the the knife and fork icon in the corner of any of your recipes:

___

<h2 id="collection">Collections</h2>

If you've got a lot of soup recipes, salads, or anything else, you can create a collection for them in Noodles to keep them together.

To create a collection, click the *Collections* link in the navigation at the top of Noodles. You can add a title, description, and even a background photo.

Here's how they look:

To add a recipe to a collection, click the new "Add to Collection" button at the bottom of your recipe. Then, click on the collections you want the recipe to be in:

___

<h2 id="sharing">Sharing</h2>

Noodles is not a social network; your recipes belong to you and are completely private. However, some recipes are too good to keep to yourself, so you can share a link :)

Click the "Share" button at the bottom of one of your recipes:

![Screen Shot 2015-09-11 at 9.52.49 AM.png](https://draftin.com:443/images/32217?token=NwsQCrKNvM4XFNfoz_hqLK0gzq4rxKR_jrGBqng4PIrHuQLgv6YQXa-1S4fcvMgdKpt-YZMTTmovwABZbjoFak0)

Then click the blue "Share a link to this recipe" button. You can send the link to that page to anyone. Here's an example: http://www.getnoodl.es/s/6ww5W0L

___

<h2 id="save-to-noodles">Save to Noodles</h2>

At the bottom of any shared recipe, anyone with a Noodles account will see a "Save" button.

![Screen Shot 2014-12-15 at 7.24.56 PM.png](https://draftin.com:443/images/25223?token=O1G1GHY9RJJZ57rU0NfFxfRu-hpk3Os4alOFdlpTN8FQ3Ajx6n6I7YC5UZhgEf8iPGGWDRthpa_mo5wz8ocdlr4)

It lets someone save their own copy of one of your recipes to their own account. They can edit it, they can share it, and someone else can save that. The original recipe owner's recipe cannot be changed by anyone else.

___

<h2 id="favorites">Favorites</h2>

Favorites are an easy way to quickly bookmark recipes you love. They're marked with a star.

To favorite a recipe, open the recipe and click the star to the right of the recipe's title. To un-favorite it, click the star again.

To see your Favorites, click "Favorites" in the filter bar above your recipe list.

All your Favorited recipes will show up in a list.

___

<h2 id="search">Search</h2>

When you need to quickly find a recipe, click the search bar above your list of recipes and start typing. As you type, your recipes are searched by name. You can search anywhere on Noodles there's a recipe list, such as in a collection.

![Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 9.03.56 PM.png](https://draftin.com:443/images/32199?token=RI-de3-KlP6L9nx3FKb-IlnY6csU13SGIez22YycLwYxP5Kqo38xfZm8W5C2H7q128nWw5pTGhJ56nKU9bqz0l0)

___

<h2 id="clip">Clip from the Web</h2>

2. Click the "link" button in the corner of your recipes page.
