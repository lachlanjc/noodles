    <h2>Lots of <a href="http://www.getnoodl.es/docs#cook-mode">Cook Mode</a> improvements</h2>

    <p><strong>Checklists</strong></p>
    <p>Keeping track of which ingredients youâ€™ve already measured in long recipes is often confusing, so youâ€™ve been able to check off ingredients for a little while. Iâ€™ve improved those checklists, and now you can check off steps too! See it in action:</p>

    <h2>Ingredient Sections</h2>

    <p>A lot of recipes have several components â€” dry/wet mixes, a frosting, a topping, etc. So now, Noodles lets you organize your ingredients into sections with headers.</p>

    <p>To create a header, just add a hash before the text.</p>

    <p><pre><code># Wet mix</code></pre></p>

    <h2>Authors</h2>

    <p>While youâ€™ve always been able to save the source of a recipe, a URL or cookbook name doesnâ€™t properly capture who originally wrote the recipe.</p>

    <p>So Iâ€™ve added a new field to recipes for the author. You can record authors for your recipes in the editor, and see that author on the recipe page. When you <a href="http://www.getnoodl.es/docs#clip">clip from the web</a>, Noodles will save author data for you.</p>
