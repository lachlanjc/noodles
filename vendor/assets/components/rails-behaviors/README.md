# Rails Behaviors

Rails Behaviors implements the `data-*` behaviors generated by Rails 3.x.

This is an alternative to [jquery-ujs](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs). First, it is all CoffeeScript goodness â€” well, that's mostly good for me! Second, it is written in a modular fashion. This makes it possible to cherry pick the components you need and replace specific functionaly without having to rewrite the entire library. Third, it uses built-in global ajax events rather than adding its own. O, one more thing, **Zepto**.


## Dependencies

**jQuery 1.7.2+** or **Zepto 0.8+**

You'll need [Sprockets 2](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) if you want to use the gem version.


## Installation

rails-behaviors is distributed through the [bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower) package manager.

``` bash
bower install rails-behaviors
```

## Testing

For testing you will need:

* Ruby 1.9.3+
* Bundler (`gem install bundler`)

``` bash
bundle install
bundle exec rackup -E test ./test/config.ru
# now open the browser at http://localhost:9292
```

## Migrating from jquery-ujs

This library handles all the `data-*` behaviors defined in Rails, so it is roughly feature for feature identicial in your Views.

The differences are in the JavaScript.

1. There are no `ajax:*` events. jQuery already has global ajax events built in, so there is no point in duplicating that functionality. Doing a find and replace for `"ajax:"` events should give you a good start. You're looking to replace `ajax:success` with `ajaxSuccess`, `ajax:error` with `ajaxError`, etc.
2. There are no global configuration options. Theres no equivalent for `$.rails`. You probably should have never used that in the first place.

**NOTE:** You **cannot** use `rails-behaviors` and `jquery-ujs` at the same time.
